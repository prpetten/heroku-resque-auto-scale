= heroku-resque-auto-scale

Auto scale your resque workers on Heroku. Original code by darkhelmet:

* http://blog.darkhax.com/2010/07/30/auto-scale-your-resque-workers-on-heroku
* https://gist.github.com/501160

I just bundled it into a gem for easy inclusion into other projects.

= Changes in this version were made to accommodate the following:

  * Support of the Heroku Cedar stack
  * Usage with resque-scheduler gem (resque >= 1.20.0 - min version needed fro resque-scheduler)

= Usage Rails 3.x Add the following line to your Gemfile.

gem 'heroku-resque-auto-scale'

Once the gem is installed, simply extend your job class as follows:

  class ScalingJob
    extend HerokuResqueAutoScale if Rails.env.production? # only extend in production

    def self.perform
      # Do something long running
    end
  end

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
